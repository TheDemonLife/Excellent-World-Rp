# Excellent-World-Rp | Source code
Role project game server GTA: San Andreas.
The source was flooded here because of the uselessness of the code. The server is fully stable. The maximum online server was â‰ˆ60. The server fully supports MySQL and works fine on Linux. The author of this code is not me, but I introduced further changes. 
> WARNING! The server is completely in Russian! This server was operated on the territory of the Russian Federation.
